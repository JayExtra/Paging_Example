# Paging_Example
a simple application that demonstrates offline caching using paging3 library and room database

The application utilises the jetpack library components namely:
1. paging3 for fetching layered data from the network
2. hilt for dependency injection
3. Room for offline caching
4. MVVM with repository pattern

This is the best way to demonstrate offline caching for applications. This in turn reduces your application data
consumption. It will also make the application usable even in low network conditions.
Other libraries used as well include:
1. Glide for image loading.
